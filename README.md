This is the source code of the http://lov3lyme-rif.rhcloud.com/ site
initially published under http://lov3ly/me on openshift.

It is a webapp written in go with no framework, using mgo (http://labix.org/mgo),
gorilla toolkit (http://www.gorillatoolkit.org),the goods (http://www.thegoods.biz) and 
a few other libs. Initially it was storing the photos in an S3 bucket.

It was developed very fast to get friends feedback and than later abandoned, so it has almost no comments or tests.

I have decided to make the source public hoping it might help someone. Hopefully I did not left any passwords in the code.

Enjoy!
